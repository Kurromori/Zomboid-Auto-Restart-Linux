# Zomboid-Auto-Restart-Linux

This is a Project Zomboid auto restart script I made for those who created a dedicated server in Linux.

## How it works

- The [Udderly Up To Date](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844315442) shuts down the server and ultimately the process if it finds a mod has been updated. Which is then detected by the auto-restart.sh. Since the script is trying to find whether the process start-server.sh is running.  It has two decisions. If it is not running it will start the server, If it is running it will sleep for n amount of time until it detects that the process is not running.

## Requirements

 - [Udderly Up To Date](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844315442)
 - My scripts
 - Screen
## Tutorial
- Add [Udderly Up To Date](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844315442) to the mods.

- Place both the auto-restart.sh and start-server.sh to anywhere you want. Open up the (start-server.sh) script and modify it. Change the directory to where your project zomboid server (start-server.sh) is located and the servername to the name you want. This provides an easy execution when trying to start or restarting the server.

 - Open the auto-restart.sh and modify the script to how long you want to check whether the server is running or not. (default value is 15m). Make sure that the screen name is the same as the one inside the script (the one in the script is named pz, you may rename this as you wish so long as it is the same of the screen you created)

- Create two terminals that could multitask using Screen, one is dedicated for the server and one is dedicated for checking if the server is running. (If you want to stop checking the server, just terminate the screen.)
